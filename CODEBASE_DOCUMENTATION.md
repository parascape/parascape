  - **vendor file error.txt**: Likely a log or error-report file pertaining to vendor dependencies or integrations; typically not part of the core codebase.

## 3. Build & Development Tools

- **Vite:** Bundler for fast development and optimized production builds.
- **TypeScript:** Enhances JavaScript with static types for reliable development.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Tools to maintain code quality and enforce consistent style.
- **Supabase Integration:** Configurations and tools to manage backend services using Supabase.
- **VSCode Dev Container:** Facilitates a consistent development environment across different setups.

## 4. Setup and Development Workflow

1. **Dependency Installation:**
   - Install dependencies using npm or bun as defined in the `package.json`.

2. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Configure necessary environment variables by setting up the `.env` file (and `.env.production` for production settings).

3. **Running the Application:**
   - Start the development server using the Vite development command.

4. **Using Scripts:**
   - Leverage scripts in the `scripts/` directory for tasks like building, testing, and deploying the application.

5. **Containerized Development:**
   - If using VSCode, utilize the configuration in the `.devcontainer/` directory to ensure consistency across development environments.

## 5. Deployment

- **Netlify Deployment:**
  - Deployment is configured via the `netlify.toml` file. Ensure your Netlify settings are updated accordingly, and use the `CNAME` file if a custom domain is in use.
- **Production Environment Variables:**
  - Make sure to set up production variables in the `.env.production` file before deployment.

## 6. Contribution Guidelines

- **Coding Standards:**
  - Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations to maintain code quality and consistency.

- **Testing & Commits:**
  - Validate changes through existing tests. Follow repository guidelines for commits and pull requests.

- **Documentation:**
